<p>The objective of the game is to move all three blocks from the first base to the third and have them laid out in the same arrangement.
But there are a few catches. You can only move one block at a time, every move involves taking one block and setting it on another base, and no disk can be put on top of a smaller disk. You can play by selecting the base to highlight the topmost block you'll need to move
and then selecting the base you want to move that block to. </p>
